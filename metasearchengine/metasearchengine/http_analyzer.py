class http_analyzer:
    #In this class you take an http url as input and check if the url fits for category-1 or category-2
    #If it fits in category-1 then you better filter out all three components from it
    #Otherwise you direct it to spider-2
    #the link we get is a deep link so we get hands on the link for the data
